I was tasked to create a coding quiz game that would:
start after clicking the start button
have a set timer given the number of questions.
proceed to the next question after answering the question
if the answer was incorrect to decrease the timer further
and stop the quiz when all the questions have gbeen asnwered or the timer reaches 0.

I then had to also save the highscores into the local storage.
